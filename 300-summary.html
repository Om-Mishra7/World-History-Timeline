	At the start of this century, the Sixteen Kingdoms of China begins, which will come to be a chaotic period for the next 140 years. 
	This is a chaotic century for the Roman Empire as well. The emperor Constantine the Great rules the kingdom fromm 306-337. He puts an end to the persecution of Christians, the first step of the becoming of new state reiligion. Constantine also makes Constantinople the new capital of the empire. However, it will only stay that way until the year 395, when the empire splits into two halves. 
	Christianity spreads a lot during these years and becomes state religion in Armenia, the Kingdom of Aksum, and in the Roman Empire.
	In Mesoamerica, Siyaj KÊ¼ak, an important figure for the Mayan civilization yet still with an unknown political position, conquers Waka, Tikal and Uaxactun all in the same year. 
	The Eastern Miditerraninan is hit by a enormous earthquake, so called the "365 Crete earthquake". It created tsunami waves which hit not only modern Greece but also Libya, Egypt, Cyprus, Sicily and Spain. Almost all of Crete was destroyed.
