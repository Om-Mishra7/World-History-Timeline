## contributing

every kind of contribution is highly appreciated no matter how small or big.

### how to contribute

1. fork the repo.
   * click the fork button located somewhere in the top right corner
2. implement your contribution.
   * for beginners i would recommend editing files directly through the UI
3. submit a pull request against the `master` branch!
   * GitHub's [official instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for making pull requests

i try to keep this project easy to navigate for everyone, not only people
with programming experience. if you find this project hard or confusing to
navigate please let me know and i will try to fix it.

for now the best way to contribute would be to improve and write summaries
for all decades, you can find all summaries in the 'summaries'-folder. these should
be fairly easy to understand and edit.

#### contributing with summaries

i've written a very simple [markup language](https://github.com/tavro/WHT-markup) for making the process of writing summaries a little easier.

if you want to edit a summary do the following:
  * go to [WorldHistoryTimeline/summaries/markup/](https://github.com/tavro/WorldHistoryTimeline/tree/main/summaries/markup) and find the file you want to edit
  * follow the syntax listed in this [file](https://github.com/tavro/WHT-markup/blob/main/README.md)
