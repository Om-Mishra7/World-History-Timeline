                            as heralding the "European miracle" of the following centuries. 
                            The architectural perspective, and the modern fields which are 
                            known today as banking and accounting were founded in Italy.

                            universe, which was met with strong resistance, and Tycho Brahe refuted 
                            the theory of celestial spheres through observational measurement of 
                            the 1572 appearance of a Milky Way supernova. Galileo Galilei became a 
                            champion of the new sciences, invented the first thermometer and made 
                            substantial contributions in the fields of physics and astronomy, becoming 
                            a major figure in the Scientific Revolution.
