## contributing

every kind of contribution is highly appreciated no matter how small or big.

### how to contribute

1. fork the repo.
2. implement your contribution.
3. submit a pull request against the `master` branch!

### rules

* **do** conform to existing coding style.
* will be expanded if needed.

## contributions :trophy:
* I know that someone very special will be on this list soon

## todo :clipboard:
* write summary for every century and decade from year 0 up to 2020
* design and user experience improvements
* add important people under each year from 1 up until 2022
* make it possible to navigate backwords on the timeline when you've entered a century/decade/year
* add attributes to people, example: title, country, known for and so on
* fix the footer section 'made by Isak...', it looks weird on phone-resolutions

## ideas :bulb:
* add CMS to make the contribution process easier
    * add markup language to easily format text

    maybe make my own markup suitable for this

    * alternatively use server side html and includes

    example on includes:
    ```
    <include src="./[century]-summary.html"></include>
    ```

* group people by region, relations and so on

* upgrade to newer web technology that has support for components

## bugs & cons :warning:
* unknown at this point
