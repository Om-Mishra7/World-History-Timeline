## contributions :trophy:
* I know that someone very special will be on this list soon

## todo :clipboard:
* write summary for every century and decade from year 0 up to 2020
* design and user experience improvements
* add important people under each year from 1 up until 2022
* make it possible to navigate backwords on the timeline when you've entered a century/decade/year
* add attributes to people, example: title, country, known for and so on

## ideas :bulb:
* add CMS to make the contribution process easier
    * add markup language to easily format text
    * alternatively use server side html and includes

    example on includes:
    ```
    <include src="./[century]-summary.html"></include>
    ```

* group people by region, relations and so on

* unknown at this point
